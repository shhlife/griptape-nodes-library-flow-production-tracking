# Griptape Cloud Nodes

This library provides Griptape Nodes for interacting with Griptape Cloud APIs and services. You can use these nodes to interact with any of the available Griptape Cloud APIs.

**IMPORTANT:** To use these nodes, you will need an API key from Griptape Cloud. An API Key should have been generated for you on the initial setup of Griptape Nodes, so you may use that key. Please visit the [Griptape Cloud console](https://cloud.griptape.ai/configuration/api-keys) to manage your API Keys if needed.

To configure your keys within the Griptape Nodes IDE:

1. Open the **Settings** menu.
1. Navigate to the **API Keys & Secrets** panel.
1. Add a new secret configuration for the service named `Griptape`.
1. Enter your `GT_CLOUD_API_KEY` in the respective field.

## Add your library to your installed Engine

If you haven't already installed your Griptape Nodes engine, follow the installation steps [HERE](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes).
After you've completed those and you have your engine up and running:

1. Copy the path to your `library.json`. Right click on the file, and `Copy Path` (Not `Copy Relative Path`)
